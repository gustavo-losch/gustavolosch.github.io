Hi, I'm **Gustavo Lösch do Amaral**, an undergraduate student and researcher for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Ponthifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS). I like to learn about programming, IT infrastructure and a huge fan of any type of Motorsport competition. Here you'll be able to learn from things I've done, my current projects and more things I like.
